This Python program, implemented using the pygame library, is an interactive aim trainer game. The objective is to click on dynamically appearing and disappearing targets on the screen within a limited number of lives. It tracks the user's performance metrics such as speed, accuracy, and elapsed time.

Features:
1. Dynamic Targets: Targets grow and shrink dynamically, adding a challenge for the user to click them in time.
2. Performance Tracking: Displays real-time metrics such as time elapsed, speed (targets per second), hits, and remaining lives.
3. Game Over Screen: Displays the final statistics, including time elapsed, speed, hits, and accuracy.
